Matrix Multiplication
(1)	Generate dataset -> MatrixMulSpace.cu
		level = 5
	if separate models required for separate datatypes
	(3)	Generate dataset for int, float, short, double
	
Experiments based on occurrences of CPU and GPU fit problems
(4)	CPU/GPU -> 1/2, 1, 2, 3

Measure prediction time average
	tpre-avg

Measure attainable gain when CPU and GPU fit problems are in fair ratio i.e., 1

Sigma(tGPU-tCPU+tpre)
	#cumelative sum of each problem


Caching Advantage Proof
	Distinct 100 problems and 10000 problems stream
		Disable caching -> average time
		Enable caching  -> average time
